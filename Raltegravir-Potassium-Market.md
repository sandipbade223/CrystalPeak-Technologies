The demand for antiretroviral drugs continues to rise as HIV remains a global health challenge. Raltegravir, specifically, offers a unique advantage in that it can be used in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, making it versatile and valuable in HIV management. Additionally, the drug's low side-effect profile compared to some other antiretrovirals enhances its appeal among both healthcare providers and patients. The increasing penetration of combination therapies that include Raltegravir Potassium is also a significant driver for the market's growth.
